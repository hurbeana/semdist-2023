\section{Introduction}

As technology rapidly evolves and the demand for real-time applications increases, new network challenges arise. Traditional best-effort packet delivery offered by standard Ethernet networks may not adequately meet the needs of real-time applications, such as the upcoming Industry 4.0 automation, particularly in the \gls{iot} and \gls{cps}~\cite{Wollschlaeger2017}. \gls{detnet} emerges as a key solution, providing guaranteed latency and reliability for data transmission across various domains.

The origins of \gls{detnet} can be traced back to the development of IEEE \gls{avb} standards, which aimed to provide synchronized, low-latency streaming of audio and video data over Ethernet networks. The need for such a solution stemmed from the fact that larger audio/video systems were increasingly difficult to maintain and required purpose-built hardware. Additionally, \gls{avb} allows normal Ethernet traffic to coexist with the audio/video traffic, which is a key feature for the adoption of \gls{avb} in professional environments~\cite{Lim2012}. The IEEE 802.1 task group responsible for the \gls{avb} standard renamed it to \gls{tsn} after completion to better reflect its extended scope, which includes other types of real-time traffic, such as automotive and industrial control traffic~\cite{Wollschlaeger2017}.

In parallel, industrial serial field bus systems, such as ProfiBus or Modbus, and industrial Ethernet, were developed to address the specific needs of automation and control systems in industrial environments since best-effort packet services, like standard Ethernet, were not suitable for such applications. The main issues with solutions such as standard Ethernet networking include high cost and unpredictability of traffic due to collisions and congestion loss~\cite{Finn2018}. Still, these early efforts laid the groundwork for the evolution of \gls{detnet}, paving the way for the advancements we see today. This paper explores the concept of \gls{detnet}, its importance in overcoming the limitations of best-effort packet delivery, and its relevance in many real-world applications.

The paper begins with a ``background'' section that provides a historical context and discusses the developments of \gls{detnet} and time-sensitive networking. It then examines the constraints of best-effort packet delivery and the need for specific latency and reliability guarantees for certain application classes. Additionally, an overview of proposed IEEE 802.11 Standards is presented.

The paper subsequently provides an overview of different domains where \gls{detnet} plays a vital role, such as industrial automation, cellular operation, and professional multimedia. Within each domain, exemplary \gls{detnet} use cases are presented, showcasing how \gls{detnet} can significantly enhance performance, safety, and efficiency.

Finally, the paper discusses the technical foundations that enable \gls{detnet} to build on best-effort packet networks and offer the required guarantees for latency, reliability, and jitter. Key architectural components, protocols, and enabling technologies are examined, providing a deeper understanding of the technical foundations of \gls{detnet}.

By examining the history, applications, and technologies underpinning \gls{detnet}, this paper aims to provide an overview and understanding of the significance of \gls{detnet}. With the continued growth of the \gls{iot}, \gls{cps}, and Industry 4.0, \gls{detnet}'s importance is poised to expand, shaping the future of connectivity.
