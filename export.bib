@article{Li2022,
  abstract  = {With the rapid development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology and
               machine-type communications, various emerging applications appear in industrial
               productions and our daily lives. Among these, applications like industrial
               sensing and controlling, remote surgery, and automatic driving require an
               extremely low latency and a very small jitter. Delivering information
               deterministically has become one of the the biggest challenges for modern
               wire-line and wireless communications. In this paper, we present a review of
               currently available wire-line deterministic networks and discuss the main
               challenges to build wireless deterministic networks. We also discuss and
               propose several potential techniques enabling wireless networks to provide
               deterministic communications. By elaborating the coding/modulation schemes of
               the physical layer and managing the channel-access/packet-scheduling at the
               media access control (MAC) layer, it is believed that wireless deterministic
               communications can be realized in the near future.},
