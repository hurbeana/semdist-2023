   abstract = {Current resource reservation architectures for multimedia networks do not scale well for a large number of flows. We propose a new architecture that automatically aggregates flows on each link in the network. Therefore, the network has no knowledge of individual flows. There is no explicit signalling protocol, and the protocol overhead mainly consists in the introduction of a packet type with three values (reserved, request or best-effort) which can be encoded on two bits},

   abstract = {With the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cyberphysical system (CPS) concepts in industrial application scenarios, industrial automation is undergoing a tremendous change. This is made possible in part by recent advances in technology that allow interconnection on a wider and more fine-grained scale. The purpose of this article is to review technological trends and the impact they may have on industrial communication. We will review the impact of IoT and CPSs on industrial automation from an industry 4.0 perspective, give a survey of the current state of work on Ethernet time-sensitive networking (TSN), and shed light on the role of fifth-generation (5G) telecom networks in automation. Moreover, we will point out the need for harmonization beyond networking.},

@article{Li2022,
   abstract = {With the rapid development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology and
machine-type communications, various emerging applications appear in industrial
productions and our daily lives. Among these, applications like industrial
sensing and controlling, remote surgery, and automatic driving require an
extremely low latency and a very small jitter. Delivering information
deterministically has become one of the the biggest challenges for modern
wire-line and wireless communications. In this paper, we present a review of
currently available wire-line deterministic networks and discuss the main
challenges to build wireless deterministic networks. We also discuss and
propose several potential techniques enabling wireless networks to provide
deterministic communications. By elaborating the coding/modulation schemes of
the physical layer and managing the channel-access/packet-scheduling at the
media access control (MAC) layer, it is believed that wireless deterministic
communications can be realized in the near future.},

   abstract = {Many emerging applications require a higher level of flexibility, modularity, and efficiency but are dependent on advancements in communication infrastructure and distributed computing. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) standards aim at providing vendor agnostic, reliable, and deterministic communications over the Ethernet, but lack in flexibility and modularity provisions. In this context wireless communication systems are preferred given the obvious benefits in terms of increased flexibility, reduced deployment & maintenance costs, and inherent mobility support. However, the stochastic nature of the wireless medium poses several challenges in achieving these benefits. In this paper we comprehensively analyze the recent standardization efforts and developments in IEEE 802.11 and 5G to enable low-latency, deterministic communications and present the current status of their integration with wired TSN. Then, we present a set of use cases that may be enabled by wireless TSN including industrial automation, automotive, or audiovisual applications.},

   abstract = {A number of companies and standards devel- opment organizations have, since 2000, been pro- ducing products and standards for “time-sensitive networks” to support real-time applications that require a) zero packet loss due to buffer conges- tion, b) extremely low packet loss due to equip- ment failure, and c) guaranteed upper bounds on end-to-end latency. Often, a robust capability for time synchronization to less than 1 µs is also required. These networks consist of specially-fea- tured bridges that are interconnected using stan- dard Ethernet links with standard MAC/PHY layers. Since 2012, this technology has advanced to the use of routers, as well as bridges, and features of interest to time-sensitive networks have been added to both Ethernet and wireless standards.},
